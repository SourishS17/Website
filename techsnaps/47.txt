<p>The Google hardware keynote event was yesterday - and it was very interesting. I'll give an overview of what occurred and my thoughts!</p>

<p>First off, the video itself was a bit 'meh' in terms of quality. There was nothing too impressive like Apple's September events, but I heard that from a media perspective, the Google event was better because it was a live event and had a better hands-on section. Google also hosted it in New York, to support the local area and help an under-funded arts theatre. Even though this is mostly for PR, Google is still really great when it comes to helping the community ethically. And this brings me to what I think is the best new Pixel feature - guided frame. It's genius. I think it's absolutely awesome. It's designed to help blind people take good selfies as the phone will give voice instructions telling the person how to position their phone to get a good selfie. Great work, and a great idea, Google! The phones themselves are the same prices as last year, and for European regions, this presents fantastic value considering inflation and the quality/specs of the smaller of the duo. The Pro variant is, of course, still a huge jump up in money over the standard.<br><br>The phones are great, with normal year-on-year improvements as expected. However, the G2 chip was very interesting. It seems like not much was changed compared to last year, but Google almost created the illusion that the TPU was a new addition this year (it was probably developed further though). The 2 other impovements were the leaked new GPU chips, as well as general minor upgrades in clock speeds and display processing. Overall, it's not too exciting but it should hopefully lend itelf to better battery life (despite the 6% reduction of battery size this year!).<br><br>The watch is great, looks beautiful, but has big bezels. Google tried very hard to obscure the bezels through the UI, though, and I think they did a great job. It's quite funny when you look at the flashlight feature - the edges of the screen fade away to create the illusion that the bezel is much smaller than it actually is. Very smart from Google, and I think this will end up as a real benefit. The watch has some fancy strap mechanisms, but also only comes in one size - 41mm. This is quite a good size, but people with the largest of wrists may struggle. When it comes to price, the watch costs more than I would have expected, but at least it has lots and lots of Fitbit tech in there (with a heart rate detection frequency of 1Hz!) thanks to Google's acquisition a while ago. What is interesting is how you have to use the Fitbit app for the best experience, and not the Google Fit app. There's a lot of confusion between what to use so hopefully this is ironed out!</p>

<p>And the final thing of the event was the tablet. This just seemed like a normal, decent Android tablet... until the ah ha moment. When it clicked for the million people watching - it can dock. It's a Nest Hub Max with a detachable screen. Genius. Pure genius. This product is great, and Google clearly identified how useless tablets are in most households so found a way around that. I love this idea, just so so much!</p>

<p>Anyway, I've only skimmed over the main points of the event; be sure to watch it in full if you want to know more! But I'm excited for the Google ecosystem - the one thing they kept pushing all event. Oh, and their immensely funny digs at Apple. Google seems to be in the game now, and they know it - doubling production of the Pixel 7s over last year's products. I can't wait to see what they do next...</p>
