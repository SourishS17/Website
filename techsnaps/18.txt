<h1>Logitech's new handheld leaks</h1>
<div class="main-content">
<p>Evan Blass, on Twitter, has leaked some more information about the Logitech handheld gaming device which they teased earlier this year. Evan is a very reputable leaker, so the image he supplied is probably accurate. The device will be called the G Gaming Handheld, and you can sign up for email updates on their website (which I've just done!).</p>

<p>The device, unlike the Steam Deck or Nintendo Switch, will be a cloud gaming handheld - it won't have some beefy electronics inside but it will instead stream games, allowing the user to sign in to popular services such as GeForce Now and Steam. The rest of the device will look like a normal handheld, similar to the Steam Deck. Clearly, lots of companies think that cloud gaming is the future as it means that you can play games which are very high quality without needing a powerful device, and without needing lots of storage space to carry the game with you. However, what you do need is a good internet connection. A very good internet connection if you want a good experience. This limits the potential audience for cloud gaming services a lot, but hopefully as 5G arrives everywhere and homes get faster WiFi, cloud gaming can begin replacing conventional gaming.<br><br>But there are still the concerns that people have with cloud gaming - you are locked into paying a subscription to a company or else you cannot play the game. It's not like a DRM free game that you can download and take to any device to play any time in the future as well. As the cloud popularises, though, we have to accept this reality - the reality that cloud computers are insanely powerful and more convenient.<br><br> Back to Logitech's product, since it's basically just a specialised smartphone, I'm hoping that Logitech use the space and budget wisely to create an inexpensive device around &#163;150, and have a good 1080p (or higher) AMOLED screen, with good stereo audio, tactile buttons, and most importantly - a large battery. The meh battery on current handhelds is perhaps the biggest limiting factor, but if Logitech can cram in low-powered components, they have lots of space for a truly all-day battery life champ. It will be super interesting to see what Logitech does with this device, and how many units they will move. Either way, I'm very pumped for the future of handheld gaming, and am excited to see Logitech get into the industry with such a unique, innovative, and futuristic idea!</p>
