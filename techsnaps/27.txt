<h1>Google faces more Union battles</h1>
<div class="main-content">
<p>In the past couple of years, lots of workers in the famous cafeterias of Google offices in the USA have joined a union, fighting for better pay and benefits. As the people who work to feed Google employees are contracted and therefore not actually hired directly by Google, a lot of Google's policies and employee benefits are not applicable to these workers. The most recent office to unionise is Google's Atlanta office, and reports suggests that workers make just $15/hour, and don't get any benefits. This compares to other areas that have already unionised and struck a deal - rising pay to $24/hour and increasing benefits such as health insurance. Google perhaps isn't entirely to blame here though, since it's also the contracted company that strikes the deal with Google and are in charge of their employees.</p>

<p>But, Google is still an evil company (like all big tech), so I'm positive that they are largely to blame for the low salaries. In general, I have very mixed feelings on unions. Personally, I am severely affected by the influx of train staff strikes organised by unions here in the UK, so my experience with them has been incredibly hasslesome. And yet, I can also understand where the unions are coming from. It's a tough thing to crack, but in this case of Google, I side with the Union. Google has so much money - they can at least afford good working terms for everyone that works inside their offices, whether they be Google employees or not. Especially because Google only has a cafeteria for their own profits.<br><br>The free food is a highlight of the job, as it's much easier to just get food there than have to plan and pack some, or have to go out and buy some. I've experienced this first hand at my recent work experience at Cambridge Consultants - everyone there loved the food and it clearly increased company-employee relations as well as boosting productivity and attracting the best engineers. So it's quite greedy of Google to do this, and if they don't agree with the reasonable union demands... well, then they'd either have to find a new company to contract and spend loads of money, or just not provide free food. Oh, and to be fair, the food isn't even THAT good so Google should also invest more to get nicer lunches - but it is made at such large scale so the staff deserve more money. Either way, it's a little concerning to see unions take over the world, but if it means greater equality and better lives for all, I'm no one to be against it!</p>
