<p>Finally, the monent we've been waiting for! A Wednesday September Apple Event in 2022. This time, the first since 3 years ago, their flagship event is in-person. I have mixed feelings on that, because whilst it is great for those who are actually invited to the event, it probably also means a lower production quality as Apple would typically make super extravagant and cool videos with all sorts of shots and animations in virtual launches. Maybe they'll have the event filmed but also an in-person element with hands-on and alike. On the plus side, we'll get more interesting comments from media that is lucky enough to go.<br><br>Based off the leaks, and suggested by the name of the event "Far Out" and the graphic featuring what appears to be clusters of stars in space, there must be something to do with astrophotography. Perhaps they are introducing a new photography mode in the latest iPhones, or, more likely (based off leaks), a periscope camera in the high-end variants. *sigh*... No one wants a periscope lens. No one. Other than a gimmicky party trick, they have extremely limited use in day to day life, and if you really care about 'astrophography', you would likely have more specialised gear anyway, instead of a &#163;1£200 iPhone. The periscope zoom is merely used for marketing to make a product seem cool - one of the few marketing gimmicks I truly despise (along withcurved screens and the 2MP macro camera). However, as peak slab(!) smartphone has arguably been reached, we cannot expect major improvements and must brace for basic changes or minor enhancements.<br><br>Either way, I'm still super pumped for the event - and you should be too!</p>
