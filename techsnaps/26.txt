<h1>LG digging for cloud gaming</h1>

<p>LG just released a marketing video advertising their OLED evo TV, through the use of cloud gaming. It's very interesting that LG are beginning to get really heavily invested in this area, but I'm happy that such a large company is rooting for cloud gaming's success. The OLED evo is actually quite a good TV for console gaming, although I am just a massive sucker of OLED screens in general! However, as much as LG hope cloud gaming to be the future, even just looking at the YouTube video comments, we can see that so many people have no idea what it is, so there's still a long way to go. I'm interested to see how the market splits now, and who sides with what type of gaming. LG, as a TV maker, would also have an interest in the console market, but perhaps they think consoles are going die next generation? Either way, I maintain the POV from my the 30th AUG techsnap.</p>
