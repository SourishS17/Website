<p>Nothing has just released their new earbuds; the Nothing Ear (stick). Yes, we have more of that silly naming convention! Anyway, it's quite an interesting product. It has no silicon tips, but instead a hard plastic bulb. Nothing claims that this will fit ears better and be more comfortable to wear for long periods of time when compared to the Ear (1). To compensate for the additional sound leakage, Nothing says that they are using a larger driver and also use some fancy algorithms to adjust the EQ, providing a greater base than what would otherwise be present. They also went on about software enhancments and blah blah this blah blah that. I just hope that all these software improvements come to my own Ear (1).<br><br>The 16-minute event was hosted by one person, with no appearance of Carl himself. She talked about a lot of the small things that the team focused on to make the experience of using the earbuds better. There also seems to be some decent ecosystem benefits for users of the Phone (1), such as low-latency mode automatically activating when they enter a game. Anyway, this product launches for a pricey &#163;100. And follwing Carl's tweet from just a few days ago, I'm not sure fans are too happy about this. Carl recently Tweeted that the original Ear (1) is increasing from &#163;100 to &#163;150. He cites the rising costs of components (which is valid), but also cites that they released 15 firmware updates in the past year. Soooooooo good support means you can jack up the price a year later? Oh well, this feels a little like what Meta did with their Quest 2. After mass adoption was nearly reached, and popularity boomed, they raise the price just to try and actually make some good money. Fair.<br><br>BUT, I think that the real reason for the price hike was in preparation for this product. It's clearly a more lower end device, with no ANC (which many people were also annoyed by), and so it has to have been priced less than the Ear (1). But pricing these too low would obviously not be too profitable and perhaps Carl is feeling the pressure from his investors to start making profit, in light of the financial crisis. Especially as he's based in London, investors would be quite edgy to get their ROI back. And some thoughts on the marketing - it continues being very, very unique and confusing. However, I think it can be quite successful to target the more fashionable group, showing that Nothing are different from the rest of the saturated market. Although, I do think that some of their marketing is a little too much. Anyway, it's a decent product, but you're definitely paying for the design more than anything as Nothing cements itself in the industry and continues building on their foundations. Let's see where it takes them!</p>

<p>Also, it seems that the Ear (stick) is multifunctional - it's also a lipstick product! The Lip (stick)...</p>
