<p>Starlink recently launched their maritime service, which costs significantly more than their typical business dishes. It costs $10,000 upfront, and $5,000 per month from there. Ouch. However, customers are usually willing to pay a premium for any sort of internet connection on the sea, so having Starlink with good internet connection capable of allowing good quality video streaming could appeal to many customers. The only issue is, that as the Starlink network becomes more saturated on both the land plans, and the maritime plans, internet connection will decrease for everyone. So if most of the 7000 passengers on Royal Carribean cruise ships with Starlink buy the plan, internet could be painfully slow. Moreover, Starlink is making lots of deals with other cruise ships, so the congested routes on sea will also have limited bandwidth.<br><br>There is hope, however, as Starlink is still relatively new, and (in the grand scheme of things) the technology is still in its infancy. Musk claims that some major upgraded satellites will soon replace the network, so hopefully the 350mbps promised maritime speeds could increase. Either way, it's awesome to see Starlink being so successful, and travelling across the world to infiltrate areas that would otherwise not even have a connection, such as cruises and campervans. However, does this go against the spirit of the holiday? That's up to you to decide, but I think global internet access is fantastic!</p>
