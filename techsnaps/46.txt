<h1>Google launches African data centres</h1>
<div class="main-content">
<p>Google has launched 2 new cloud regions in South Africa, expressing plans and current development in increasing that number across the continent. Cloud regions are just areas where Google has a data centre, and therefore where users can store their data. This may be useful for law-related issues - where the data is stored helps determine the laws that surround it, so storing data in a different country to the company's base could be confusing. Google is using their private undersea "Equiano" cable between Europe and Africa to drive the data centres, and the cable is already linked to other major cities such as Lagos.</p>

<p>Of course, it's great that under-invested countries in an under-invested continent are now receiving lots of support by private companies; Google claiming that $2.1 billion dollars will be added to the South African GDP, alongside 40,000 new jobs as a direct result of their services there. However, Google also said a few other things. They were going on about giving users the "choice" to store their data in the cloud wherever they choose to, continuously pushing this idea of freedom of choice.<br><br>Which is very ironic. And given all the anti-trust issues with Big Tech, I'm almost inclined to believe that this African expansion is for two reasons purely. The first is obviously profit - investing heavily into a lot of developing economies with huge populations will allow Google to gain an early foothold into the market there, and therefore continue holding that for decades to come. More importantly, however, I think this is mostly a PR stunt. With Google executives and managers being so vocal about something like this, and given the phrasing of their statements, it's clear that they are trying very hard to get on the good side of the public. It almost seems like they are a charity helping out LIDCs, but in reality, looking at their data centre locations, we notice that they are all in the most economically developed regions of Africa - clearly a sign of profit-oriented growth as opposed to community support. Also, given that other top providers like AWS and Oracle already have data centres in the continent, Google probably felt pressured to join in.<br><br>And the fact that they joined the party quite late suggests they had no real goal of improving Africans' access to cloud services. They don't do it for desire to "help entrepreneurs", or to help "make smarter business decisions", or for the "element of choice". Whilst these are all valid benefits, I'm positive it's not what Google thinks about beyond PR. The choice part is quite critical though, because servers much closer to a location are significantly faster and noticeably so. They also help companies remain in line with regional laws, such as Kenya's law requiring all user data to be stored and processed within the country.<br><br>Either way, even if Google's intentions are wrong, at least they are still helping the continent infiltrate the age of technology. Despite the illusion that they are trying to fabricate around choice, they are still ultimately doing good so we should accept that fact but continue to remain very cautious about Google's actions, and note their intentions moving forwards.</p>
