<h1>Japan is phasing out old tech</h1>
<div class="main-content">
<p>Japan's Minister of Digital Affairs, Taro Kono, has declared a war on floppy disks through his Twitter account - it's quite a funny account for a government official. The Japanese government still uses lots of retro and 'out-dated' technology, such as floppy disks, fax machines, CDs and more, but Mr Kono is clearly not a fan of the use of these. He's a newly appointed Minister, so it's at least promising to see him take such action this early. He also asked "where can one even buy a floppy disk these days", and he raises a very good point - why make the citizens of Japan try and find floppy disks? Japan are instead going to move towards more internet-based services in terms of interacting with their citizens. He wants the country to use modern, state of the art equipment wherever possible, and thinks that eliminating the use of fax machines is his first priority.</p>

<p>Lots of governments still use old technology, and especially for a country like Japan which is a tech hub for the world, spurring out the latest and greatest innovations in the industry, it's crazy to think that these countries are still run using technology invented over 60 years ago. There are lots of security issues with this as well, and whilst a floppy disk may be inherently secure, it's also an extremely terrible product in the modern day. It's great that Japan is taking this step, and hopefully they'll have fully transitioned in a few years. However, Japan also has a very high life expectancy so maybe there are still lots of elderly people who prefer the old and familiar tech.<br><br>Either way, we need to move on and governments need to take security more seriously in general. Governments are typically run by people who are, to be frank, too old to understand technology, and this leads to so many issues. Off the top of my head, one example is a South Australian county minister who tried to charge a citizen for 'hacking' a government websites exposing SS numbers. All the 'hacker' did was inspect element a web page. Yep. And that's the reason we need more tech-savy people running the country - technology is advancing too fast for politics, a double edged sword. I'm glad to see a G7 country publicly take this step, and hopefully it will set an example for every other country.</p>
