<h1>Meta Connect 2022</h1>

<p>Meta just had their annual Connect event, and it was very, very interesting. First off, the video quality was actually awesome - a huge variety of punchy scenes, bokeh done perfectly and really slick transitions. The structure of the event was very well planned too. Just a generally epic video and the production team deserve credit for that. Pure and utter eye-candy.<br><br>Anyway, one of the key things that they released in the event was the Quest Pro. It's a Â£1500 device aimed for enterprise use. It has some of the cutting-edge tech that meta is working on. The event was more about a series of motifs, ideas, and statements - so I won't be talking a whole lot about any specific device or service.</p>

<p>One key thing that was being pushed was privacy - as big tech continues working on their illusion and acting skills, I'm here to tell you that it's all fake. They talked about having your own private space in the virtual world, and how (just like the real world), you can choose who has permission to enter and when. Of course, I'm absolutely certain that Meta has their own backdoor into everyone's virtual space but we, of course, ignore that! Just like the inevitable back door they have into our encrypted WhatsApp messages.<br><br>They also really pushed the idea of open source and freedom throughout the 85-minute event. Just listen to these quotes I noted - "philosophically, we're focused on making the platform more open", "[App Lab is an] open distribution channel", "[the Metaverse should be] accessible", "open experiences". And they are but a small snippet of what Meta said. It follows the idea of accentuating how open and accessible they are, creating the illusion in society that they are the good ones here - pushing humanity forward. I also think that Meta are trying to popularise the Metaverse as there perhaps aren't as many people interacting in VR as they would like, and not as many companies producing content. The whole event felt like an ad for the Metaverse as the future of everything.<br><br>But Meta have noted very impressive growth, mentioning the revenue and users several times throughout the stream. They claimed over $1.5 billion has been spent on the Quest Store, and noted that loads of companies are making money in the millions extremely quickly. So Meta must have earned at least $500 million from quest store purchases already. And this can only grow as headset adoption increases. And Zuck wants all 200 million people who buy PCs every year to buy his own headsets. Ambitious.<br><br>When it comes to games, there was some pretty big news. Among Us finally has a release date of the 10th November! It does look just as cool as when the initial teasers were out. Also, Population: One - perhaps my favourite game on VR, is getting a massive upgrade; a sandbox mode. You can now make your own maps, and play community-made maps too which is an incredible feature that should make the game even better. I'm really looking forward to this!</p>

<p>And graphics were given some time too, as they "started with simple graphics" which we all knew thanks to Zuck's pathetic Facebook post not too long ago. Meta claimed that they've made it easier to develop much better graphics for Quest games. In fact, they were talking about working hard to maximise the potential of the chip inside the headsets to do very complicated tasks. Zuck showed us some examples near the end, such as the neuron control and avatar and object scanning. These features were unbelievable and it's really petrifying to think that a company as large as Meta is not just working on these features, not just has them already working, but is trying to push them out to hundreds of millions of humans. It's crazy. Meta probably even only shows us the tip of the iceberg when it comes to their cutting-edge tech. Of course, the features are still super cool, but they can also be used to collect data, and telemetry is a serious concern.<br><br>Meta talked about how VR is a sensual experience, the key word being "experience". They referred to it as an extension to society, and how the Metaverse is a social-oriented space with most users in the past few months spending loads of time in the social spaces. In fact, Meta tried to infiltrate every part of out lives, it seems. They talked a lot about VR for gaming, working, socialising, and even exercising. Meta even showed how one company had all their employees working through VR headsets, and to be fair to Meta, they seem to be building some crazy tools for productivity and meetings in VR. They have this really cool meeting room, which is just like a real one with a whiteboard and post-its, etc.</p>

<p>We also now have legs in avatars! Meta claimed it took so long because there is no leg tracking capability in the headsets, and the leg mechanics have to be nailed for it to work properly. They said they use a lot of AI to predict an accurate motion of the legs, and they also use AI in the facial expressions on avatars. The faces are much more detailed, and expressions should now all work once the user pre-trains the AI with a short clip of themselves. I do mean it when I say that I think Meta has some alien technology and inhumanely smart engineers! Ah and since these avatars have so much personal information about us, Meta will do their thing and happily encrypt the avatars so that absolutely no one can steal them...<br><br>And let's get back to hardware. Exercising with a headset is such an interesting idea - surely it's limiting, uncomfortable, and very dirty. However, Meta are releasing a fitness pack that has some better controllers and a facial interface designed for fitness on the Quest. Wow. They are desperate to get people exercising in their world. Meta are hoping for a more integrated experience with the real world and VR, pushing for AR usage both with the Quest Pro, and some of the tech demos they showed. Speaking of the demos, Zuck did some in a virtual theatre, and there was an audience. It reminded me of the WII characters, and they all kept throwing loads of confetti in the air for no apparent reason the entire time. It was mega distracting and hilarious. Defo worth a rewatch hehe. But you just can't take the Metaverse seriously when they do stuff like that.</p>

<p>Anyway, overall, the event was a great watch, lots to learn, little time-wastage, and lots of exciting tech that tickles my enthusiasm. There was lots to laugh at, too. I'm looking forward to seeing what happens in the future, but I just hope that Zuck doesn't get out of control!</p>
