<h1>Tim Apple trialling search ads in Maps</h1>
<div class="main-content">
<p>Apple is thinking of bringing ads to some of its first-party apps. So far, Mark Gurman (who has a very high track record) claims that Apple has been internally testing search ads in their Maps app. This would work similarly to sponsored results you'd get on Google - where the owner of something pays more to the company to get their product appearing higher. In the case of Maps, restaurant owners will be able to pay Apple to get their restaurant pop up first when people search for restaurants in the area. Apple already employs this idea in the App Store, so it won't be unheard of from them. As Apple tries to expand their software service business, is this the right way?</p>

<p>It would certainly disadvantage the smaller, more local businesses in an area who cannot afford to pay for high ranking-searches and therefore get overshadowed by the larger companies. This is not ethical from Apple, but at least it seems like they won't use collected user data to influence the results - something Apple themselves are stopping Meta from doing through their app transparency. However, it's also not the user-centric philosophy they claim to have; I don't want whoever pays the most to appear at the top, I want the place with the best reviews, the place that is closest to me, etc. As Apple wants to continue being king of global business, they have to expand beyond just their iPhones, which are variable sources of revenue compared to a steady sponsorship deal with thousands of businesses across the world. Apple's services sectors clearly aren't growing as fast as they want, so they probably feel forced into the advertising realm, not a good decision for consumers. At least, however, they'll do it the 'Apple' way, and won't be like Samsung or Xiaomi, and start having random ad pop-ups across their UI (for now...)!</p>
