<h1>Tensor G2 is interesting...</h1>
<div class="main-content">
<p>Google's first in-house SoC, the Tensor 1, was released last year and put into their flagship Pixel 6 line up (and later in the Pixel 6a). It was quite a good chip, but had raw performance slightly lower than competition. Google claimed that they optimised it well for AI workflows, and tasks that the Pixel specifically would need to do. However, it did have some thermal and efficiency issues that were slightly relieved through software updates over time. But now, the Pixel 7 is just around the corner.</p>

<p>For the new chip (and the new, better, naming convention), they kept all the same CPU cores, but upgraded the GPU from a Mali-G78 to a G710. This should bring huge efficiency and performance gains to the chip, enhancing the ML processing even further. The CPU cores have been clocked at slightly higher speeds though, but still remain far below the competition. This choice is interesting, and it seems that Google is ensuring they have a much more efficient, and less power hungry chip. The Snapdragon 8 gen 1 was a massive power consumer, and had plenty of thermal and sustained load issues. Qualcomm managed to somewhat fix this in their + variant a few months ago, but sustained performance is still lacking. Perhaps Google is taking a more Apple-esque route by ensuring what they release is highly optimised and, overall, gives a better user experience over raw numbers.<br><br>Of course, Apple still has the fastest chips anyway, but if Google focuses more on this user experience element, I think the Tensor G2 could be a big success. If they've managed to notably increase performance from last year, but increase power efficiency and design a stronger thermal solution, then the Pixel 7 could be a fantastic all-rounder. I'm excited to see what Google can bring to the table, but considering how they are using, to be frank, outdated technology on their SoC, I would expect the new flagship to remain the same affordable price, despite inflation and rising costs. The process used is 4nm, and next year is expected to be cuttine-edge 3nm from Samsung. These slight overclocks and smaller transistors lead to around a 10% boost in multicore performance on Geekbench.</p>

<p>The leaks themselves seem to be quite reliable (lots of fact-checking occurred), and have been released on Twitter through a dev with a good track record. It's expected to have been a pre-release device, ahead of the official launch in just a couple of week on October 6th. If Google does deliver on this, they have a lot of hope to not just revive the Pixel brand, but make it the go-to Android device.</p>
