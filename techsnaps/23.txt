<h1>Twitter finally adding an Edit button</h1>
<div class="main-content">
<p>Twitter is internally testing an edit button for Tweets, and claim that later this month, the feature will begin to roll out to the public, first to Twitter Blue customers. The idea is that, within 30 minutes of sending a Tweet, you can edit it as many times as you like. A small edit icon and timestamp will be provided, as well as full version history. On the whole, I think this edit feature is incredibly, astronomically, and unbelieveably stupid. And yet, it's still somehow the most requested feature for Twitter.</p>

<p>Twitter claims that it is primarily for fixing typos, mentions, and alike in a Tweet you just posted. And they also claim that to maintain conversation integrity, they publicise the Tweet history. But there's just no point to this feature. This goes against the whole point of Twitter, which is a space where you can just make random comments in the time and never change them. It's like the time is preserved in the Tweet. Also, who on Earth would need to edit a Tweet within 30 minutes. If you make a typo that you later want to fix, that's just very dumb. It would be so much better to actually skim read what you wrote before you send it, and fix any errors at that point - which THE rule of social media. How does it make sense to later on realise you made a mistake, then have to quickly go and edit the Tweet? Oh, and this is after you get a load of comments about your typo.<br><br>Overall, I just think this feature is useless, a waste of time, and utterly stupid. Firstly, it's crazy that people actually want an edit button - whilst most people were probably thinking an edit button with an infinite time limit as opposed to 30 minutes, what is the point of that? If you change the Tweet, it's not how Twitter is meant to work, so you might as well just delete it if you care enough. Of course, people would have certainly already saved a copy of it so there is, again, no point to this dumb feature. It's very, very disappointing to see Twitter decide to focus on such trivial and stupid things, especially when there are so many bigger issues they need to address - such as the insane amount of Twitter bots. Overall, Twitter as a company really just sucks. A lot. No matter whatever they claim to care about, they don't.</p>
