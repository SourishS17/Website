<p>Yes, Samsung is almost as bad as naming as Elon Musk...<br><br>Samsung just released a new, very very cute avatar! His name is G∙NUSMAS, or Samsung in reverse, and he's a little alien. Samsung released a newsroom post about him, and claim that he's a long lost top-secret employee of Samsung, but now he's come back from his planet (aptly named Nowus-129, their South Korean HQ address in reverse). Samsung will be releasing a series of videos and social media content showing the alien's journey in detail, and use the little guy in branding moving forward. His alien-nature was inspired by people claiming, and I quote, "Samsung must have hired an alien being to design and develop its innovative technologies".</p>

<p>This virtual avatar replaces Sam, who we saw some time ago from Samsung. She blew up on the internet, with everyone talking about her. However, as some more inappropriate comments were made about her, Samsung didn't use her much. But G∙NUSMAS is here to stay it seems. And I sure hope he does! Samsung will launch him fully on September 2nd as IFA 2022 kicks off, and people will be able to talk to him through the website or on the metaverse.<br><br>It seems that, to reach a wider and younger audience, Samsung are really invested in this cute alien. They want him to have a greater presence on the internet and serve as a brand identity to convey their principles (such as the blue colour, their space-themed marketing, etc.) and have said that he's geared towards Gen Z people. He'll probably pop up in lots of branding - especially branding designed for social media. I think this idea is awesome and the execution is cool, however, Samsung are clearly just playing with people through G∙NUSMAS to try and increase business using an emotional connection - not the most ethical. Imagine if more companies follow suit... soon we'll be using avatars to represent brands! Overall, I find this affair very entertaining :D<br><br>And yes, I'm definitely buying a stuffed toy piece of merch the second it's released!</p>
