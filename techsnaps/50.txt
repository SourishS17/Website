<p>The second largest cryto exchange in the world, FTX, has recently filed for bankruptcy. And in a terrific but rapid descent, the company's infamous CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) has stepped down. This news has taken over the internet and stormed Twitter - rightly so. First off, we'll address the elephant in the room. Storing money in a crypto exchange just isn't a smart thing to do - and I'm no financial advisor, so this is just my opinion (though one which is a consensus among the educated). The history of exchanges haven't been good, and they really only exist to <i>exchange</i> money between currencies, not to store it. So the millions that used FTX may have their money frozen and ultimately, lost.</p>

<p>SBF was regarded as an extremely intelligent individual, with a valuation in excess of $15 billion just a few days ago. He was widely respected and famous in the industry, being a young player (30 year old) who even spoke to court on behalf of the crypto market as he lobbied plenty for pro-crypto laws - his company not being very USA-friendly to the point where he (Binance also did this) had to make a new spin for the USA to comply with stringent regulations. SBF was a tycoon, diving deeply into the influencer space to leverage the parasocial relationship by convincing influencers that FTX (and related services/companies like BLockify) was the future, and the smart place to store money. He was portrayed as generous, humble (because he drove a modest car), and a genius - perhaps portrayed through his messy hair, confidence, and fast talking speed. Yes, society is a weird thing.<br><br>Anyway, these influencers made a massive impact across the globe as FTX popularity skyrocketed and even reputable investors and financial advisors took to the service. Of course, now they are all reaping the issues with FTX. FTX is just a bank, nothing more. Even though it uses crypto, it's still centralised and therefore negates the entire purpose of crypto in the first place. In fact, it's worse than a bank. Because at least banks have federal support and consumer protection laws (meaning you can't lose your money if the bank suddenly went bust, or closed off all transactions). Use a wallet, people, a hardware or software one is fine. That's the purpose of crypto - only get into it when you're well versed and don't just follow the trend; don't just jump on the bandwagon that you feel part of through YouTubers - they are not advisors. They are essentially bribed messengers.<br><br>In fact, this raises a very ineresting point about just how much power YouTubers have in changing the way people think. And it's scary. We should constantly be weary of what we hear and see on the internet, questioning everything and researching before even touching our money. In general, many YouTubers know far less than it may seem - but very few people are critical and most are just complacent. The issue is, it's not really their fault; in the busy life of a human, we don't have time to become an expert on everything so we have to trust someone at some point. Unfortunately, this was not the right person or the right point.<br><br>Anyway, I'll spare you the details of the collapse (since you either know about it, or can quickly find out). But the moral of the story is that you can't have debt as an exchange, and you definitely can't pay people using your own crypto because if someone takes out a large sum of the token (FTT, in this case), the value plummets and everyone else rapidly does the exact same thing until you have no money to give to thousands of people who trusted you. Yep - FTX are in a massive mess and the new teams have a big job on their hands to fix it...<br><br>But also, there were several signs to show that FTX was not a good service to store money in. First off, the <a href="https://ftx.com/" target="_blank">website</a>. Their web design is utterly and indisputeably bad. Being such a rich company with billions and billions in assets, you'd expect them to be able to hire some decent web devs - but nope! Compare this to a service such as Binance (which is better in basically every regard), and you'll quickly understand what I mean. How can we trust a company that doesn't put that attention to detail? A company that isn't willing to spend [relative] pennies on a good website? Also, the sheer amount of infleuncer invovlement is generally not a good sign of anything. It means the company is spending a significant amount of money and is relying on masses of non-experts to use them (although they still managed to fool experts, which was scary). None of these are good signs, but they are really basic signs that anyone can see through!<br><br>The rich and powerful have so much influence and can do anything they want, but maintaining transparency, using crypto responsibly, and questioning our parasocial friends is the way to go. But for now, another crazy genius has lost control...</p>
